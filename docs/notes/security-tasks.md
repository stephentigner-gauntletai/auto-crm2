These are the basic security measures suggested by Claude.

For basic security measures, I propose we implement the following:

- Rate Limiting
  - Add rate limiting to our API endpoints to prevent abuse
  - This is especially important for the login and ticket creation endpoints

- Input Validation & Sanitization
  - Add more robust input validation on all forms
  - Sanitize user input to prevent XSS attacks
  - Add maximum length restrictions on text fields

- Authorization Checks
  - Add middleware to verify that users can only access tickets they should be able to see
  - Ensure customers can only see their own tickets
  - Verify team members can only access tickets assigned to their teams
  - Add checks for ticket modification permissions

- CSRF Protection
  - Add CSRF tokens to our forms to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks

- Headers Security
  - Add security headers like:
    - Content-Security-Policy
    - X-Frame-Options
    - X-Content-Type-Options
    - Referrer-Policy

Ended up only implementing the rate limiting.
